They have an amphitheatre seating type arrangement where live bands play amazing music every night!

The food is a delight and you have a lot of options to choose from burgers to tacos to chineese and crazy lip smacking deserts.

Must visit on a weekend if you want to have a chill night out with you folks! ",4

The place overlooks a spread of huge lit space which is soothing to eyes and looks spectacular. The dishes made were very nice and drinks seemed good. Overall i would give it a 5 star.

As a college-goer with limited money, their cakes, which were priced reasonably were good enough for my cravings (even though they were overloaded with cheap sugar syrup n tasted the same). It’s been some time since I stopped going completely. Why? Over the years, the condition of the place has deteriorated - both in quality and service. 
Try some other cake shop in the vicinity. If you are, however, looking for inexpensive pastries and cakes, you may want to try it out. ",2
4,1,58268," We were around Kormangala and wanted to visit a good restaurant and we found Fennys by the Forum Mall. We ordered Sweet Sunrise and it was quite good. We started off with Onion Rings, Fried Chicken Wings and Devil Beef Chunks and they were quite good. We then ordered the Farm House Pizza and it was satisfactory, but did not match the quality of the starters. We then proceeded to order with the Tagliatelle Bolognese, Prawns Rose Belle, Supreme Chicken with Mushroom Sauce and Fennys Chicken Sizzler and other than the Bolognese, everything else was very good. The service was which and quite responsive. Overall, Fennys is a very good restaurant and worth a visit. ",4

Went there for a dinner. For appetizers we’d ordered”M.O.P” which was delicious, in main course we had “Verona Exotica” pizza which is their specialty. The crust, the topping everything was perfect. We also ordered “Pesto Primavera with Mushrooms” pasta, it was one of the best pasta’s i’ve had in bangalore. We paired the food with “Sauvignon Blanc” & “Shiraz Rose” wine.
They had a really good selections of wines in their bar, which is a must try.
The lighting & decor was fabulous, The staff is smiling & welcoming. They kept coming back for a feedback on food & offered to reheat the food. The service was quick as a lightning, while they really manage to maintain the quality along with it. 
A real big thumbs up, will be coming back for more & more.
One of my favorite Italian Restaurants.",5
